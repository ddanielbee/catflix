Simple Web App for visualising cat pics. Yeah, cats. Internet overlords. 

This website used [instafeed.js](http://instafeedjs.com/) to pull cat pics from selected users on Instagram.
Users and Pics were then randomized and shown to the user in an infinite gallery style of app. Other perks included adding
simple tips about cat care that came directly from our database, (can't share that part). 

The app used Angular.js as front-end framework. 

I was in charge of development of this tiny app. Design and the whole idea came from the team over at [Elede Lab](http://eledelab.co)

You can visit the app and spend some quality cat time at [Catflix](http://catflix.eledelab.co).
